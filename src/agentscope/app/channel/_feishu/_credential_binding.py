"""Feishu app registration by QR code.

Feishu registers an app through an OAuth device flow: we open a session,
show the operator a URL as a QR code, and ask the platform every few
seconds whether they have approved it. ``lark_oapi.aregister_app`` wraps
that in a loop of its own and never surfaces the device code, which
would pin the whole session to one process — so the two calls are made
directly here instead, one step per request.
