"""Interactive credential acquisition for a channel type.

Most platforms let an operator hand their credentials over out of band —
scanning a QR code, approving a consent screen — instead of pasting an
app secret into a form. What they have in common is a session: it opens,
the operator acts on another device, and it ends with the same
:class:`~agentscope.app.channel.ChannelBase.Credentials` the form would
have produced.

The service drives that session one step at a time and keeps every step's
state in the message bus, so any replica can serve any request. A
provider therefore holds **no** state of its own: whatever it needs
between steps it returns as ``provider_state``, and receives back on the
next call.
