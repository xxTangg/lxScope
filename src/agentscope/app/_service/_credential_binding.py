"""Drive channel credential-binding sessions from any replica.

A binding session outlives the request that opened it but not by much,
and its steps are spread across whichever replicas the operator's client
happens to reach. So the session lives entirely in the message bus and
this service keeps nothing: every method reads the record, does one
thing, and writes it back under compare-and-set.

That is also why there is no background task polling the platform. The
client already polls us for the session's status, so that request is
what advances it — nothing outlives it, nothing needs an owner, and a
replica dying mid-session costs the operator one retry.
