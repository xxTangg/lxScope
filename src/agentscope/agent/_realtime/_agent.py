class RealtimeAgent:
    """A voice agent: a realtime model on one side, a transport on the
    other, and the turn-taking state machine in between.

    Unlike :class:`~agentscope.agent.Agent` it is bidirectional and has no
    request/reply boundary — audio flows in continuously while events flow
    out of :meth:`reply_stream`.

    Three lifetimes are kept apart on purpose. The agent owns the model
    session and the state; a transport is owned by whoever created it; a
    :meth:`reply_stream` borrows both for as long as both are alive. So a
    client can drop and reconnect without losing the model session, and
    the model session can time out during a long silence and be
    re-established on the next word without touching the transport.

    The public methods are the only entry point for discrete input. A
    transport carrying a browser's ``ControlFrame`` calls exactly those
    methods rather than reaching into the agent, so one code path handles
    the semantics whether the caller is Python or a browser. Continuous
    audio is separate and always arrives through the transport.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python
